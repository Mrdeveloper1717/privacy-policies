  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="muted">
    Developer: <b>Kitoblar Olami (Sadirboyprogrammer)</b><br>
    This Privacy Policy applies to all mobile applications published by the developer.
  </p>

  <p>
    Kitoblar Olami develops multiple free book-related mobile applications.
    These apps are provided at no cost and are intended for use as-is.
    This Privacy Policy explains how information is handled across all of our applications.
  </p>

  <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
  <p>
    Our applications do <b>not collect, store, or require</b> any personally identifiable information
    such as name, email address, phone number, or account credentials.
  </p>

  <p>
    Some of our apps display advertisements using third-party services such as
    <b>Google AdMob</b>. These services may collect anonymous data (such as the device’s Advertising ID)
    for ad delivery, frequency capping, and performance measurement.
  </p>

  <p>
    The developer does not have access to, collect, or store this advertising data.
    All ad-related data processing is governed by Google’s own Privacy Policy.
  </p>

  <h2>Permissions Used</h2>
  <p>Depending on the application, the following permissions may be used:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>INTERNET</b> — to load advertisements or online content.</li>
    <li><b>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE</b> — to check network connectivity.</li>
    <li><b>com.google.android.gms.permission.AD_ID</b> — for advertising purposes (personalized or non-personalized ads).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Security</h2>
  <p>
    We do not collect or store user data on our servers.
    Any data processed by third-party services is handled securely under their respective policies.
  </p>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    Our applications do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
    If you believe that a child has provided personal data through a third-party service,
    please contact us so we can take appropriate action.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
